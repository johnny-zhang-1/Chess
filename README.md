### Team Name: Some Asian Kid
Team members: Johnny Zhang, Nathan Gu, Albert Yu\
\
Revision Date: 5/11/21\
\
Program Purpose: The purpose of the program is to display a two player chess game that takes input from a text line (eg. h1 to h5).The program appeals to anyone who plays chess, as it provides entertainment and practice for both chess players. \
\
Target User Profile: Anyone who likes to have fun or practice playing chess with another an opponent\
\
Feature List: scuffed chess(will add checks, checkmates, and pins if we have extra time), there's a nice looking chess board GUI, CUSTOMIZABLE ASSETS!!!\
\
Instructions: Move your pieces accordingly based on how your opponent moves in chess. Enter your moves through the text field(h1 to h5) and have fun :)\
\
Class List: Board, Piece, main, ChessPanel, GameController, GraphicsExampleMain, PieceImg, Square, Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, King, Queen\
\
UML: (will be attached with the readme)\
\
Team Responsibilities: Try and stay ahead of guidelines as much as possible and make sure to complete your class(don't procrastinate please). Ask for help and help others. Make sure to share most recent version of the code on github as well so we can update the UML and readme :). \
\
Known Bugs/Workarounds: Classes currently only work separately and we need to link up the classes to make the project function properly as how we all imagine it would. All of the classes are created but most of the classes remain unfinished(Piece, GameController, Board, Piece, Pawn, Knight, Bishop, Rook, Queen, King). EDIT: Graphics can be worked with from other classes. (see ChessPanel.java)\
\
Key learnings: JPanel/JFrame usage, arrays, mouse input, constructors, conditions, strings, relationship between classes, UML creation, how to collaborate well \
