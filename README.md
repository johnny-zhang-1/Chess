#### Program Purpose: 
The purpose of the program is to display a two player chess game that takes input from a text line. The program appeals to anyone who plays chess, as it provides entertainment and practice for both chess players.
\
\

#### Instructions: 
Users will be able to input moves on a text line. For example, if it is white's turn, typing "e2 to e4" will move the piece at position e2 to position e4.
\

\
#### Target User Profile: 
Anyone who likes to have fun or practice playing chess with another an opponent
\

\
#### Feature List: 
scuffed chess(will add checks, checkmates, and pins if we have extra time), there's a nice looking chess board GUI, CUSTOMIZABLE ASSETS!!!
\

\
#### Instructions: 
Move your pieces accordingly based on how your opponent moves in chess. Click on a piece and then enter just the location where you wish to move the piece. You will see what piece you selected on the top left corner. Enter your moves through the text field(h1 to h5) and have fun :)
\

\
#### Class List: 
Board, Piece, ChessPanel, MyPanel, PieceImg, Pawn, Rook, Knight, Bishop, King, Queen
\

\
#### UML: 
(will be attached with the readme)
\

\
#### Team Responsibilities:
Try and stay ahead of guidelines as much as possible and make sure to complete your class(don't procrastinate please). Ask for help and help others. Make sure to share most recent version of the code on github as well so we can update the UML and readme :). Johnny will do the code's "skeleton," Albert will do graphics, and Nathan will do UML, readme and anything else that needs doing. (In the end, Nathan created a "skeleton" of all the classes but the graphics related, while Johnny writes the methods for the individual pieces(king, knight, pawn, etc..). Albert's role remained the same)
\

\
#### Known Bugs/Workarounds:
Classes compile with each other now. If you select a piece but don't enter a location and press enter, the piece is delete. 
\

\
#### Key learnings: 
JPanel/JFrame usage, arrays, mouse input, constructors, conditions, strings, relationship between classes, UML creation, how to collaborate well
